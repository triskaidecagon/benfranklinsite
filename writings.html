        <ul>
          <li>Franklin’s first published writings were under the penname “Mrs.
          Silence Dogood.” He was working on his Brother James’s printing press
          at the time, but James wouldn’t publish any of his writings. So, Franklin
          took up the penname and wrote letters to his brother’s newspaper.</li>
          <li>The first pamphlet that he published was named “A Dissertation upon
          Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain.” In it, he made the argument
          that free will is nonexistent, and that means we aren’t morally
          responsible for our actions.</li>
          <li>In 1732, Franklin published Poor Richards Almanack. It had
          information about the upcoming weather, along with a variety of other
          things, like proverbs. He would publish a new volume every year for
          twenty five years.</li>
          <li>Franklin was the owner of the Pennsylvania Gazette, which was a newspaper.
          Under pseudonyms, he contributed a lot of content to it. During the
          French and Indian war, he drew and published a cartoon for it, named
          “Join or Die.” It stressed that the colonies needed to join together,
          or else they would all fall.</li>
