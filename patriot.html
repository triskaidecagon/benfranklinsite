          <li>Franklin proposed the Albany Plan, which was a plan to unite the
            colonies. Although it was rejected, it would become the groundwork for
            the Articles of Confederation, which was America’s first government.</li>
            <li>He debated against the Stamp Act in Parliament, which was in London.
            Franklin’s testimony against it led to its end in 1766.</li>
            <li>Franklin was a delegate at the Second Continental Congress. He
            helped draft the Declaration of Independence, and helped persuade
            France to help America out in the Revolutionary War.</li>
            <li>Franklin also helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris with Britain.
            The Treaty of Paris ended the Revolutionary War, recognized America
            as an independent nation, and set its borders.</li>
