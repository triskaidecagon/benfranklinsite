        <ul>
          <li>Franklin did many experiments with electricity. His famous “Key and
          Kite” experiment, which he performed in 1752, helped prove that lightning
          is electricity. He also invented the lightning rod, which protected
          buildings from lightning, and created many terms related to electricity
          that we now use today.</li>
          <li>He made a musical instrument, the glass armonica, too. It was made
          of spinning glass bowls on a shaft. Beethoven and Mozart both composed
          music for it. </li>
          <li>Franklin invented Bifocals, glasses that can be used for seeing
          distant objects and for reading. </li>
          <li>Another invention that Franklin created was the Franklin Stove. It
          created more heat with less fuel. </li>
          <li>He invented a scheme that would drop the letters C, J, Q, W, X and
          Y from the alphabet. Why? He felt that it would help reduce redundancy.
          </li>
          <li>Franklin is also credited with inventing the rocking chair, a flexible
          catheter, and the American penny, along with many more things. </li>
